<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

### Project Scope

A packet filtering firewall is a network security technique that regulates data flow to and from a network. 
It is a security mechanism that allows packets to move across networks while controlling their flow through the use of 
a set of rules, protocols, IP addresses, and ports.

* User should be able to set rules on which IP addresses and port numbers to be blocked or allowed
* System should be able to log blocked or allowed IP addresses and port numbers

## Project Design

### Architecture

<img src="images/architecture.png" alt="architecture Diagram" >

> Above diagram shows the packet filtering firewall architecture

The firewall acts as a guard. It guards a corporate network acting as a shield between the inside network and the outside world. 
All the traffic in either direction must pass through the firewall. It then decides whether the traffic is allowed to flow or not. 
The firewall can be implemented as hardware and software, or a combination of both.

* It works in the network layer of the OSI Model. It applies a set of rules (based on the contents of IP and transport header fields) 
  on each packet and based on the outcome, decides to either forward or discard the packet.
* Packet filter firewall controls access to packets on the basis of packet source and destination address or specific transport protocol type. 
  It is done at the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) data link, network, and transport layers. 
  Packet filter firewall works on the network layer of the OSI model.
* Packet filters consider only the most basic attributes of each packet, and they donâ€™t need to remember anything about 
  the traffic since each packet is examined in isolation. For this reason, they can decide packet flow very quickly.

> Example: Filter can be set to block all UDP segments and all Telnet connections. 
    This type of configuration prevents outsiders from logging onto internal hosts using Telnet and insider from logging 
    onto external hosts using Telnet connections.

### Built With
